# UNCIV-THE-NEW-ORDER-THE-GREAT-WORLD-WAR
Have you ever thought or imagined if the countries changed into alternative political paths in Unciv? then this Mod is the answer!
(I do this mod when I have free time, so waiting for the update will be a bit long), {This mod is inspired by mods from the game Hearts of Iron 4}.
This mod adds new Civs, Policies, Units into the game! (This mod is still on planning to be a Ruleset for Unciv, so for now, only adds new civs, policies, and units) [This mod still W.I.P.]
